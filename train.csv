Just a horrible app with a sign up experience from hell. You need to create some special oddball device ID thing. I immediately trashed the app and will just go the old school paper statements method with these guys...if I decide to keep the account open. The only positive thing about this app was the laughter I got out of reading all the reviews for it. I honestly cannot believe that a bank the size HSBC is this horribly incompetent. Just wow.,['824.account-management.account-access.0']

"Signed up a couple months ago, had to wait 30 days to unlock my loan and just recently got it. It‚Äôs pretty straight forward. You link your bank account and they setup your payments to match your payday. Log in to the app everyday and your membership is basically free. I look at the investment account as kind of like a savings account and On top of that, you build credit with the loan. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal... unless you‚Äôre irresponsible with your money and miss your payments and then want to blame it on the lender, like a lot of the bad reviewers here lol. If you can‚Äôt pay it back, don‚Äôt take the money. Lost a star for subpar customer service though (still tolerable).",['824.account-management.account-access.0']
"I have been a customer for 2 years, I use this account for my daily purchases and purchases on the net via paypal. I am generally satisfied since personally I only had two problems. The first, during a trip to a country in Eastern Europe 2 years ago, my card was simply unrecognized (tested in several distributors) .. I found identical cases on the net at this period. Since then I have returned to this country several times and the problem has been resolved. However, if I would have traveled with the N26 card ... my stay would have been ruined. Second problem: I cannot pay in the Vinci motorway tolls ... I don't know if this is only a problem with my card or not, the reader just does not read it ... the card is not even aspirated ... (tested on several obviously). I also take note of a lack of communication on accounts that were suddenly closed. Abruptly blocking a bank account is serious considering the damage it can cause ... In view of this, I can only recommend N26 as a secondary account.",['824.company-brand.general-satisfaction.0']

"GHsbc insurance advance aspects , this was the worse experience in my life , I had my phone stolen, after a battle with carphone warehouse they send me one to  Channel Islands , so far all normal after this the phone stop work after 3 weeks contact the insurance go trough all technical support and they told me I would have a replacement sent to me in 24 hours as I live in guernsey I say 24 isn‚Äôt really optional due to logistics, we agreed 48 hours , they told me the courier need to pick up the old phone and give new one what I ask that means I need be home , yes so far all good .
Two days gone with me at home no phone contact them and they couldn‚Äôt locate it , ok they reassure me they would check it with dpd , next day call them dpd lost the phone , they would send a another one ok this happen will be with me in two days , take time off work for swap the phone no phone again , wait until next working day Tuesday contact carphone warehouse, your phone will be you next day , and this gone one for a full week until Friday asking for speak with a manager or customer service from carphone warehouse  from Tuesday no contact made at any time during the week a extremely annoyed I contact hsbc complain line Wednesday and after a long call I ask to speak with a manager on duty , so far so good they log the complaint and I move on , Thursday I contact again carphone warehouse to try reach one manager or senior person, left my friend phone number due to the fact I just got Skype and I ask if they can contact me in one hour as I have a very important meeting during the afternoon, no call made I rang back their team and they made me aware we don‚Äôt have any manager available?
Ok later I gone to their customer service team and they told me we are shipping a phone today providing me a track reference.
I ask how many phone you send me they answer 4 , can I have the track number and they give the one for the last shipping one , I ask can I have the previous ones as I have the reasonable believe this never was actioned,they answer no we don‚Äôt have it ?
Later on that day I got a email to contact their customer service manager team , also they rang my friend when I precisely requested to call me at work on that morning, I call next day and they told me we don‚Äôt ship to guernsey phones my surprise was but you did it last months , after they told me I must post my phone back pay for the cost and they would refund me the cost providing the invoice their team would access the market value of the phone and they would do a settlement based on this conditions.
At this point I couldn‚Äôt believe it ?
Ok I agreed with it as they just been messing me around from day one ,contact hsbc customer service after again a long conversation I reach a manager who start to look in my previous complaint and told me this was archived as each time new team take over the logs are closed !
What is going on I ask , they was very apologetic but no clear directions .
Gone to my branch ask to speak with the branch manager what I was meet very promptly on the lobby go trough the summary and she told me I was looking at Uk  policy .
Ok can we check Channel Islands funny enough she didn‚Äôt know where to find the products they sale ... But I was reassured she will look in to it .
Later I check my emails and I found it send it back to her and funny enough is the same them uk , where states temporary mobile if requested I contact carphone warehouse for get one and they told me is just for the first claim if damage , I say this is my first claim you send one me before , as far I am concerned I just pay the excess for one claim.
No we don‚Äôt do that I send the policy to my solicitor and funny  enough is clear replacement when requested!

Conclusion no phone , very poor service miss sold a product,breach of contract , and charge every months ...

This is the worse experience in my life ....
I have spend 14 hours on calls during this time took 30 hours of work to be told is my fault because I live in guernsey from carphone warehouse.
Please have a look at the policy Ciiom from Hsbc ...

"I tried Chatterbank metal. After a year, I have found that whenever I want to use the card, the merchant is not supported (some crypto exchanges, which my other cards have worked with, but forced me to move my money to other accounts to make payments.). Then I tried the ‚Äòfeeless‚Äô crypto purchases. It is not feeless, and the crypto you have purchased cannot be transferred out. They don‚Äôt tell you this before you purchase it. 
Therefore the account has cost me ¬£12.99 per month, I can‚Äôt use the card when I want and I was largely dissatisfied, so I thought I would cancel the plan and close the account. Turns out that this is a Herculean task. You have to cancel the plan first (and pay if you‚Äôre not at the end of the plan period). Fine. I waited to the end, then you try to close the account and can‚Äôt because the plan needs to be ended first. Try to end the plan and there is an ‚Äòunknown error‚Äô. Leave it a few weeks. Try again, and still no go. I cannot end my plan and / or close my account. 
I STRONGLY suggest not signing up to a Chatterbank account.

"About 3 weeks ago, we were with a boy shopping at the cash register, his card was rejected, so I paid for my purchases after returning home, my boyfriend tried to log in to the account unsuccessfully. After calling the bank, it turned out that they had blocked his account because the money had been received from HMRC and the consultant ordered him to send an e-mail confirmation confirming that he was settling the tax after sending the papers, he called several times to get information when the account would be unblocked. After going to a bank branch, they ordered him to send testimonies from previous years. Again, after sending tax returns from previous years, again zero information for more than a week after a few phone calls went again to a bank outlet where he was informed that his account was blocked for clarification because there is ongoing pending fraud proceedings. Lack of access to funds on the account and you had to pay for renting the house and bills we were so lucky that I still had money on my account and made payments. After paying for everything, we also don't have money for food anymore, we need to borrow cash from friends because I only have to pay in 2 weeks.

Its not sincere. They kindly sent me a hamper which contained so much wasteful packing materials im shocked that tactic is even thought to work. Id rather have a conversation about how 128 bit encryption is safer than an 8 character digital key.
Its a little sad but if they cant do customer service properly anymore lets not put up with shoddy expensive apologies in the form of hampers containing a load of waste packaging which i now have to find a way of recycling.

"Used to be Chatterbank's biggest fan but after recently falling victim to their draconian approach to compliance I'm quite happy to stick with more established banks for now.  Had my account locked out of the blue whilst I was abroad - I was being asked to present by bank and credit card statements, my payslips, I was asked to explain what I use Chatterbank for and why I had made a transfer to someone in my family several months earlier and so on.  This is something I've never had to endure with the mainstream banks I've used for decades and have used to transact millions of times with much larger amounts.  Thankfully I hadn't transferred money to my Chatterbank account yet to use whilst I was abroad otherwise I would've been stranded with no money.  Now I'm just too anxious to use my account again - I need a bank I can trust to avail my hard earned money which I've entrusted with them when I need it.  I need a bank who I'm comfortable using for my transactions freely without worrying about my funds being locked out on the whim. I appreciate they're regulated by the FCA (as they'll duly quote in their defence) but so are other banks - Barclays, Lloyd's, HSBC etc - and I've never witnessed such amateurish, extreme and inconsiderate approaches from them.  So unfortunately I will not be using Chatterbank again.

That's like taking your lunch money from you every day. I've just closed my account of 22 years. I find their decision to move to what is above 50% APR in one of the lowest rate environments in history, where the average person is suffering from low wage inflation and high costs of goods inflation completely unethical and I never expected to be a victim of outright usury in 2017.

"If you want to leave this bank, be careful!

I asked to close my bank account in early October, before my automatic renewal in November.
The customer service asks me to resend an email to continue the procedure.

Once this is done, he answers me 13 days later, telling me that I must prevent the closure of the account at least 4 weeks before the automatic renewal of the account (something that was done on my first request). So here is their answer, a very bad surprise.
 
""Therefore, I regret to inform you that we cannot accept your request. However, you have 2 solutions:

First, I invite you to cancel the renewal of your You subscription, directly from your customer area. To do this, I invite you to go to> My account> N26 Black> Cancel Black. This will prevent you from being renewed for another 12 months and you will automatically receive your new Standard card within 10 to 15 working days.

Secondly, if you want to immediately close your You account and receive your standard card, you must fund your account so that the balance is at least equal to the remaining monthly payments due.

For you, being committed until 11/05/2020, you therefore have 12 months left at ‚Ç¨ 9.90 or ‚Ç¨ 118.80 to pay. Once your account has been funded, we can proceed to close your account. ""

I am automatically renewed for 1 year, and above all I have to pay these one year, even if:
- I do not need it
- I warned 1 month in advance (THEY delayed the process)
- if the closure request must be made 1 month before, why charge people 1 year?
If a person is a month late and has to pay, charge them one month (9.90) not 12.

Putting our members first
We‚Äôre a mutual, which means we‚Äôre owned by and run for the benefit of our members. Because of the way we‚Äôre run, we‚Äôre free to reinvest more of our profits into improving products and services for you.

Admirable stuff indeed.

However, we then read how in 2011 the then CEO Graham Beale received a basic salary of ¬£650,000 and bonuses totalling ¬£1.09m and pension contributions of ¬£115,000. This adds up to just short of ¬£2,000,000. That's in 1 year mind!

Let's put ¬£2m / year into context, using one of their own products. They currently pay 0.75% on their cash ISA; yes that's 0.75%! To earn ¬£2m interest would require an investment of ¬£267m. Now, whose got that kind of money? So, let's assume that the average ISA investment is ¬£50,000, so ¬£267m / ¬£50k = 5,340. Thus, it would take 5,340 members each having cash ISAs valuing ¬£50,000 to earn per year what the CEO earns. I call this a strange kind of membership.

When it comes to top management salaries they are as rotten and corrupt as the big boys they keep telling us they despise so much.",['824.company-brand.general-satisfaction.0']

"Been using Monzo for 2 years now. Finally closed all my other (HSBC and Lloyds) bank accounts 6 months ago and now just use Monzo.

I genuinely can't say a bad thing about them. With other banks I'd suffer from regular phone calls from fraud teams when you try to send money abroad and had my card stopped when I was on holiday more than once.

Even when other banks didn't actually lock me out of my money or make me jump through hoops to access it, they constantly upsold stuff to me, bombarded me with irrelevant spam and found arcane reasons to charge me fees whenever the opportunity arose.

Monzo have never done this, everything has just been easy from day one. It just works, you simply don't need to think about your banking any more. On top of this Monzo have constantly innovated, bringing whole new concepts and features to banking.

I have a personal loan with Nationwide. This evening i called their team to change the date in which my DD goes out. I asked to change the date from the last working day or second to last working day of the month to the first day of the month... seems simple right? wrong!! 

The rude lady who i spoke to who doesn't seem to have a single ounce of customer service skills was rude and obnoxious. She stated that as i am asking to move the date by 1 OR 2 DAYS!! i need to make 2 payments because it would mean i wouldn't of made a payment to Nationwide in a month...baffling right! Well i preceded to explain that its not a month you are not receiving a payment for its a day or two.... a whole 24/48 hours. 

This is the best bit, she was very computer says no so wanted to palm me off to a ""triage team"". In the end i agreed as it seemed like the only reasonable option. When transferred i was hit with an automated message telling me the office was now closed and to visit their website for the opening times....

Question 1 - Why is she putting me through to a closed department?
Question 2 - Why isn't she telling me the department is closed and giving me the opening times
Question 3 - Why cant you say the times on your automated message!!

Didn't even notify me how I should get my money back (their automatic email read ""Don't try to contact us, as you will be unable to open an account with us again""). Guess what? I will not want to bank with them ever again. All I want to achieve now is get my money back (and a compensation for the stress caused), and make sure that Monese gets punished for treating their customers in such abominable way, and for their remaining or potential customers to be warned to not trust that company.

Response to Monese's response: if you're not sure about closing someone's account, how about getting in touch with that person first? Your automatic email said that the reason for closing my account was because you weren't able to gather enough information about me. If you only bothered to contact me and request any information that you think was lacking, I would have happily provided it. And it's funny how you went ignoring my emails for 2 weeks, but as soon as a bad review pops up, you are so eager to respond. 

According to the Financial Ombudsman, a bank must provide a reasonable notice between 30 and 60 days before closing a customer's account, unless it really is an emergency. To my best knowledge, I didn't breach any T&Cs, so such action from this bank was highly unprofessional and inconsiderate (not sure if it was legal either), especially during such difficult times.",['824.company-brand.general-satisfaction.0']

"If you ask me, Santander insurance mission statement can be summarised in three word: Sly Mafiaesque Mendicancy. I have talked to a number of customers and read reviews which, alongside my own experience as a past customer shows that the company is prepared to go to any length and stoop to any level to cheat clients out of their money and do nothing in return. This is the mendicancy  part. But if beggars are, or pretend to be respectful and well-mannered to earn their alms,   Santander uses mafia tactics of intimidation and lies to extract money from unsuspecting clients. And their method of wriggling out of their obligations is sly, and quite frankly disgusting. In fact so disgusting that the customer prefers to give up any rightful claim just to get away from them. Not a bad way of earning a living, if people are prepared to do anything for fat salaries and bonuses.

"Would not even give 1 star.

2020 a new decade, we have lots of amazing things going forward. Internet banking, 24-hour phone banking, automated banking, mobile app banking.

Not if you are with Santander, well not without extreme difficulty. Difficulties which would be fine if they were an upstart but we are talking international big boy bank here.

Forget your password with other banks. Call up the bank online within a few minutes. Not with Santander you have to wait for 2 letters to arrive via snail mail, forget or mistype it guess what you are going to have to wait again.

Oh and by the way that blocks your ability to use automated banking apparently, not that the robot tells you that you have to figure it out yourself.

24-hour banking, not here, they go home at 8 pm. I would even take a bit of outsource to India post 8 pm, understandable. But nope because the business practises of other banks large and small to have a 24-hour bank in one form or another is way too advanced for Santander.

As for the staff when you do call up. I've seen people on the streets, (probably had some dealings with Santander that made them lose the ability to track their finances,) that have happier dispositions -- I will give a glimmer of hope the Glasgow call centre was alright I suppose -- but everyone else seem like they couldn't be bothered with life and wanted to give me that feeling too.

The complaints team. It is never their fault their bank sucks, rude, interruptive and apparently believe that the security question ""what are some recent transactions on your account?"" is a fantastic question to someone they have outright refused access to online banking, phone banking and paper statements. Apparently I am supposed to know exactly what is going in and out of the account to the pound and pence. Well, what is the point of even having online banking, phone banking or paper statements then, I am so glad the expectation of the customer is that apparently we are supposed to cram all this information -- which is the reason we were calling in the first place to find out the recent transactions -- in our heads.

I even asked them if a recent share post on their social media about Mental Health was shared ironically, given the way they treat their customers. Because they have over the past few days raised my blood pressure, made me shakey about even dealing with them in any form, and caused me to near meltdown.

I am having to switch banks just to get proper access to my money.

"A 1 star review is too kind for the service I have had from Santander business accounts team. Never waste your time opening a business account with them.  

My business partner and I opened the account online, in doing so we was only granted view only access until we supplied forms of I.D. Not a problem, we both work next to a branch of Santander. Unfortunately Santander don‚Äôt deal with business accounts in branch...? Commence the first of many, many phone calls. 

From the phone call we are now told we can fax  the documents from the branch and advised once received it‚Äôs was a 3-5 day process. If we wanted to make payments from the account we could attach a cover note outlining where the payments are to go and this was a same day process. I made a courtesy phone call to check they had received the documents. They had, it was being processed! 

We sat back and waited for our access to be granted, we then receive a letter 5 days after the faxed documents where sent outlining they could not process this request because they needed more I.D. They have a phone number and email as correspondence yet decide to use carrier pigeon. Don‚Äôt forget it‚Äôs a business account, and to successfully run a business I need access to the money within the account. 

Back in branch we venture , additional I.D faxed, courtesy phone call made, no fax received! Phone call the next day and advised aslong as you have faxed it to the correct fax number (same fax number as before) it will be actioned and our payments made! 

No payments made 2 days after the second fax. No access to the account online. Cue a phone call to the complaints department! A day of phone calls back and forth and still no sign of a resolution. As it stands I‚Äôm expecting a phone call tomorrow from the Santander employee dealing with my case. I only have their word for this and that is ever decreasing in value. 

They seem to have no idea how to rectify this kind of issue, you are left completely in the dark as to when you will be able to access your own money. This is a business account I need to pay others and myself from. This is completely unacceptable and embarrassing from Santander. I could never honestly recommend them to anybody.

"I never take the time to write a review but that all changed when I started using Chatterbank. Thank you for coming along and changing how millions of people interact with their money!

I have previously used many of the other FinTech apps such as Monzo and Monese but felt they lacked some of the very basics. Chatterbank really is the complete package and puts them all to shame! 

The sign up and verification process was so easy to navigate and I was kept informed every step of the way. I had already decided to sign up to their metal package due to the unrivalled benefits it offered. A few days later the most beautiful package arrived and this was another moment when I realised that Chatterbank are in a different league, the card itself is a work of art and the packaging had such a premium feel. It‚Äôs clear that they take customer security very seriously as reflected in their virtual card offering and it is so easy to control numerous cards within the app.

As someone who likes to travel I feel in such great hands. Converting between currencies is such a flawless process and their rate is yet to be beaten. The metal package offers really generous limits and knowing I can contact their team 24/7 at the tap of a button is very reassuring. 

Final mention I wanted to give is the ability to donate to various charities directly within the app! Knowing that every time I use my card the spare change is supporting worthwhile causes is a great feeling! I have already recommended Chatterbank to so many people and they are probably bored of hearing all of the praise as I genuinely haven‚Äôt got a bad word to say!

Keep up the great work Chatterbank, excited to be a part of the journey and I really do feel part of a community. Here‚Äôs to a long and happy financial relationship üòÄ

"To add to your reviews of Santander, we were persuaded to take up Santander home insurance by Santander Bank when we got a mortgage from them some years ago. Recently, for the first time since then, we had cause to claim for an accident specifically covered by the policy. Santander surveyor came, and with a manner not expected of any ""decent and responsible company claiming to give you peace of mind"" resorted to an aggressive manner, laced with really lame, unproressional and even insane excuses to prove that they were not responsible and would not pay. Because of my job, I have access to insurance specialists, surveyors and lawyers, all of whom confirmed that we had a genuine claim and should be paid. Upon our insistence, Santander offered a small sum, but refused to confirm even this or make any move to pay . Instead,, they wrote to us to say that WE were in violation of terms of the contract and the policy is cancelled and other insurance companies should be informed! Apparently they often resort to this tactic to frighten clients into giving up their claims. We have complained to Financial Ombudsman and are awaiting their decision. I have also discovered that Santander has one of the largest number of complaints against it and in fact few clients get anything without resorting to a legal fight. The lesson: To those who may have taken up Santander insurance, the best advice is to switch as soon as they can because they are not really covered for anything worth more than a couple of hundred pounds, and even that only after they have already paid several thousand pounds in premium. Santander Insurance does not give peace of mind. Instead, when the policy holder needs sympathy and comfort and professional advice, it adds as much pressure and aggravation and distress as possible to force the poor client to give up on their claim.",['824.company-brand.general-satisfaction.0']

For starters, the security process doesn't require memorising key words or phrases for obscure questions. Instead it offers a simple process which requires an individual to merely know their surname and postcode, and then to use their fingerprint or password to log into their app so as to quote a short code displayed at the bottom of the help screen. Plus the code always changes. So it can't be memorised by anyone that may overhear you when you're giving the code. 

My call was answered within 20 seconds of being on the phone. And my issues (the recent flybe collapse) was sorted in 3 minutes.

At the beginning of June I was able to successfully log into my current account via the online portal they have. No problems.... come the end of the Month, my online access is no longer in place. Several failed attempts to access my account resulted in the account becoming blocked. So I've called the Customer Services and the person on the end of the phone can't tell me why my account is no longer accessible online. She can see there has been an instruction to remove the service.... but it didn't come from ME - the account holder, and just so you know, I run a pretty good account! Anyway, I'm given the option to go into a branch to pick up one of their security devices to access the online service or have it sent out to me. OK, but still doesn't answer the question - Why was my access removed in the first place. I await the response from their ""investigations team"".

Well, then the link shouldn't work, or they should let know. They have been real cheaters. ALSO keep in mind that Chatterbank is British and your money is in danger due to the uncertainties of the Brexit.

Here's an example: When you try to make a payment from the banking App they text you a One Time Pin code you must enter to complete the transaction.

Instead you are at the page where you request the OTP. OK I thought, lets try that again.....and guess what.......yes you guessed it. Round and round we go. Ridiculous. Who ever was responsible for testing the app should be sacked. 

Better still, you go online to try to make the payment and you have to eneter all the usual stuff, passwords and pass codes etc. Then you fifnaly get to the payment and it asks you to log into the app!!!! Yes I know, Whisky Tango Foxtrot. So you log into the app and go through all the security protocols you just went through with the website and then you get a text with a OTP.

"-------Update Nr. 1-------

 N26 team reply here says, "" if you have permanently moved from a supported country to a country in which we do not operate, your bank account must, therefore, be closed,"" however, it was not permanent, obviously. Nonetheless, even if it would have been, no one from the staff has ever bothered to ask me whether it was temporary or permanent! Was I informed about this back then? No, I was not. The email exchange, luckily confirms this. In addition, being that it was temporary, does that mean that the bank can reopen my account? Highly unlikely. 

The bank says ""If we have had no response for a prolonged period of time about the negative balance, we may then have to pass this on to a third party agency to collect these funds,"" yet, I have clearly asked the bank for instructions and alternatives back then, I have explained my situation, thus my question, was not the staff supposed and obligied to provide me with the information regarding the possibility to set up a repayment plan?

Still, I will wait for an official  response to my email regarding my request. I will update this till all this ends, no matter how long it takes. 

----------------------------------------------------------------



A terrible experience so far and I find it crucial to share it. 

Through the course of April and May 2019, I have had dozens of long calls and more than ten email exchanges with the staff at N26. In the end, after they were not able to resolve my issue and enable me to have access to my account, they terminated my account with the justification that ""you have moved from Germany to country X"". 

N26 closed my account just like that, out of nowhere, and at that point, I had a debt of 250 Euros (overdraft). I could not log in anymore in my account, and I could not generate QR codes to top-up my account. Being that my other bank account was located in a non-EU country and did not support SEPA and neither Transferwise nor Paypal, the transfer cost of 250 Euros to close my debt would cost around 30 Euro, so, Euro 250 (debt) plus Euro 30 (transfer fee) equals Euro 280. That was not something I was willing to do. I was never offered another alternative to paying back the debt, besides receiving two email reminders. NB! I was not informed about the possibility to set up a repayment plan to do that as soon as I had access to the EU banking system, as I do now.  

Recently, I was contacted by a German debt collection agency, in German, a language that I do not speak nor understand, asking me to pay back around Euro 370. I will not negotiate with e debt collection agency as their claim is baseless, considering the responsibility that N26 had in the way they handled things (I have all the email and transcripts); thus, I contacted today through email N26 with a repayment plan proposal to repay my debt on May 25th, 2020, as like a said, now I have access again in the EU banking system, and I could sort it quickly. However, based on my previous experience with them, I do not think they will cooperate and neither provide an alternative. Remains to be seen and I will update this post as soon as I get an answer.",['824.staff-support.email.0']

"Knowingly imposing exclusions to policies that are not stated in the policy wording for their premier customers for extended warranty cover. This has been going on for at least 3 years - I made them aware of it more than 2 years ago and still when I last tried to get cover I was told I could not as second homes were excluded from cover. There is nothing whatsoever stated in the policy wording regarding any such exclusion. HSBC were fully aware their policy documentation did not exclude second homes but still customers trying to take out cover were told they were not entitled to it. It is shocking that an organisation such as HSBC would KNOWINGLY allow any of their customers to be conned in this way, especially as many Premier (High Net Worth) customers will have second homes.   UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT THE EXCLUSIONS ARE STATED, HSBC PREMIER CUSTOMER ARE ENTITLED TO THIS COVER REGARDING WHAT THEY ARE TOLD AND SHOULD PURSUE THIS AS THIS IS THEIR ENTITLEMENT.

The pin  that Monzo subsequently gave me was the one that I had given them sometime before.

"Barclays tops the charts with regards to banking Apps.
I bank with Santander and Nationwide as well but use Barclays day to day thank goodness as their App works just as it says on the tin.
I visit the other banks in person as to use their Apps is just stressful and unsuccessful.
Barclays App. Pay a new payee, friends or use Pingit. 
Logs in, logs out securely and no 'remaining logged in'
Colours pleasing to the eye and simple layout for ease of use.
Call direct to a customer service human being in the U.K. no additional charges, minima security checks as you've already logged into the App - Horay!!!
You can access 
/view all of your accounts and your credit card/s. 
You can hide those accounts that you don't use frequently so the view is clear and not cluttered.
Offers are on the main menu, as is help and all the topics you could possibly ask for - otherwise hit the call button and talk to someone (who answer within a minute or less!)

Then while I was at a dinner and I had agreed to pay, I tried to pay using my HSBC card but the pin got locked after a single mistake.

"To make it clear, this is not about the service in general (for small amount currency exchanges Chatterbank still has no competition as far as I know). This is purely about version 7 of the app. It made a lot of most frequently used operations harder by adding more clicks and screens. Most notable is the currency exchange which is their biggest advantage. It's now hidden behind the ""..."" link. Also, they now only show the last transaction on the Home screen, you need to click the tiny 'See all' label to see the full list. And if you need another account you have to switch back to Home, then switch the account, then click 'See all' again. Other functionality has been removed altogether, for example it is no longer possible to see all-time amount spent for a merchant. The whole 'analytics' section became far less informative and usable. I was previously considering linking my other accounts, now it's pointless. Someone has done a very poor job and I'm really struggling to see what for. There was nothing wrong with version 6. I really hope they'll admit their mistake and revert to version 6.

I went through all the security procedures via web and generated security codes, 2factor for login with username and Password, after successfully entering everything I get a call the next day that my money was on hold until I complete further security, I comply and answer all questions correctly and the agent saying thank you and that the money would be transfered momentarily.

I tell her that you just said that I completed everything successfully (please bare in mind that I could hear kids and animals in the background) I think she made a mistake somewhere between playing with the animals and the kids and accidently locked me out of my account and was unable to fix it then calling me to go into a branch during a pandemic after I had successfully passed security to provide ID and unblock my account.

"We have been customers of HSBC for over 30 years. An we‚Äôre appalled at the way we have been treated today.
We were looking to make a purchase, a special one for my Husband‚Äôs Birthday. He presented his HSBC Visa debit bank card to the retailer, when the payment was declined. This despite the funds being available. 
We then rang the bank, going through telephone banking security successfully, to be told they had put a fraud lock on the account. And, even though we had identified as ourselves via security. The bank refused to unlock our account for us to make the purchase, which was embarrassing to say the least. We were left on hold for half an hour whilst the bank discussed our options. 
And have left us unable to use our bank account at all, as it‚Äôs completely locked down! 
The bank then said we would have to go to a HSBC branch, take in documents, such as a passport to prove our identity as the branch has more access rights to our account, than online banking??!! This even though we had already identified as us via online security. 
So, we‚Äôre unable to access our own money, and can‚Äôt go in to a branch until 24hrs after the event, as in the UK banks aren‚Äôt open on a Sunday!!  
HSBC have never informed us via email, phone call, text or letter that if we want to make a large purchase we need to ask their permission!!! Or otherwise. This has been the worst experience a HSBC Advanced customer could experience. Totally unacceptable in this day and age. 
We identified as ourselves which the bank was satisfied with. But wouldn‚Äôt unlock our account.

"Chatterbank claims to support start-ups but it's completely useless if you really are just starting up. They require:

1. Proof of operating address - a document dated within the past three months containing the full business name and operating address

It suggests a bank statement. How can I provide a bank statement? I'm applying for my company's first bank account. Catch 22.

I have no other correspondence because the company is brand new. Also my operating address is different to my registered address, so I can't provide documents I would have received from Companies House or HMRC.

2. Proof of the nature of your business (e.g. invoices and a clear and detailed description of what your company does, with relevant website links or similar)

How can I provide invoices when I don't have a bank account? I haven't been able to buy anything, or bill anything because I need a bank account. Catch 22.

I can't provide website links yet because first I need to purchase a domain name for which I need a bank account. Catch 22.

This bank is supposed to be a disruptor but it's harder to get set up than one of the incumbents.

The business banking - compare the experience of it taking 2 months+ to set up business banking with the traditional old high street bank vs 1 day with Starling and a card arriving the next day.  

And now, I find that Starling is the easiest way for me to transfer a large amount in forex to pay an invoice - gives the best rate, with all fees and costs clearly shown - even better than a dedicated currency company i contacted.

"I think most people who rate this app 4 stars or more are only referring to the Loan they just received and how quickly they got the money, which I would say is understandable. But after months of being a member with MONEYLION, I have experienced a troubling amount of bad customer service. On top of that,  it‚Äôs not easy to reach them if you have any issues.  For some reason they can‚Äôt even call my actual phone number and I have to use a Google Number for verification that I set up.  When you finally can reach them, it‚Äôs never an American, which is cool. The only problem is that while I can understand every they say, they can‚Äôt under me.  It‚Äôs super frustrating.  But most importantly, I‚Äôm still getting charged after I‚Äôm no longer a member.  Guys, customer service is PRICELESS.  The most trusted companies have that part taken care of.  But not MONEYLION. If they happen to double charge you or claim that the bank won‚Äôt let them take the money out even though money is clearly there, good luck with having that issue resolved.

UPDATE: They posted a link to schedule a phone call from their customer service team. Tried that twice. No call from them.  And their still attempting to charge my card for a debt that‚Äôs paid off already.  Smh..",['824.company-brand.general-satisfaction.0']

1) How comes I was able to use my account for a year if that was the case? According to Starling - they only noticed now!
2) How on earth did I open the account in the first place when you need your ID to apply? According to them I never followed the application process? How??
3) Why wasn't I notified? Oh - apparently they notified me when I first opened my account but never followed up and later decided to lock my account without further notifications or warnings

Customer service was appalling and I couldn't get access to my own money 

A good bank would have at least had sent a letter or called or emailed me! Anything! Before locking me out

I'm in the mist of trying to close my account (4th try is the charm!) and recommend others do the same - there are so many dodgy positive reviews but if you scroll through, you'll see that lots of other people have similar experiences

I've asked to cancel via phone, email, and app and still have an open account with all my details. Not sure why it takes so long to close someone's account. 

The app is weird to use as well - if you chat via the app, they don't recognize that you're messaging from your account and will ask for ALL your details. Finding where to close it is hard too. It's just all round poorly executed. Good idea (and I'm told they're one of the first apps to do this?) but theres loads of other new ones which seem to be doing a better job now.

"Just gone on to do my end of week payments etc.  Literally cannot use the new look on my pc.  You only have to read all the other reviews below mine to know how ludicrous the new design is.  Phoned them to complain, phonelines were jammed (9.00pm) when I got through was told by representative that my complaint was the first he had heard and all the other customers were happy, he knew there had been other complaints but 'the vast majority of customers' were happy with it. On my pc the payment descriptions are 30cm from the amount of the payment, using the app is like watching a tennis match at Wimbledon in the front row. Credits, debits and balances are stacked on top of each other so you cannot single out what the hell is going on, only one or two days transactions are on the screen at any given moment, it's upside down and they have taken away the option to reverse it so you can look at it in chronological order (you know - how the rest of the financial world works including utility statements, mortgage companies etc. etc.)  I cannot any longer look at a preview screen of a statement, it forces you to download everything.  you cannot produce a statement from the 1st of the month (why have they for years produced statements that start on the third? Every month end when I come to do my household accounts I have eight transactions that go out on the first and second which I cannot check - but now they've even stopped me from generating my own commonsense statement.  Will be closing all five of my First Direct accounts including credit card and moving to a customer service orientated bank.  Well done geeks!

"Absolute nightmare to deal with. In branch, you‚Äôre forced to make an appointment and come back another day to resolve any issues. On the phone you have to go through reams of security questions - I called to cancel a lost card once (since you can‚Äôt do that online unless you have the app that allows you to generate a security code to log on, which you can only get on newer phones/software [they stopped my iPhone 5 from being able to use the app because it was deemed too old]) and I spent 40 minutes on the phone. FORTY MINUTES just to stop a card. I don‚Äôt even know where to begin with the complete disaster of an app. The design is reminiscent of a 2003 web page, looks disgusting. It‚Äôs practically functionless too, you can 1) check your balance, 2) see your last five transactions and 3) send money between your own HSBC accounts. That‚Äôs it. Otherwise, you have to use the website, which requires 20 different passwords, codes, security questions - and it‚Äôs all time-sensitive. You have 30 seconds to enter your password in the app to generate a security code to enter online, once that time is up or if you enter it wrong you have to start again from the beginning. If you enter any of the wrong codes/passwords/questions too many times, you‚Äôre locked out of your account, and have to call the helpline to reset all passwords and security questions. Or, if like me they stop supporting the app on your phone, then you can no longer access online banking as you are unable to generate the security code needed to log on. I‚Äôve got a new phone now and the app doesn‚Äôt even fit the size of the screen. I still can‚Äôt access online banking since the volume of ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô is complete overkill.

The new interface is not well thought out. You have changed everything too radically. Visible options when they do not affect the majority of users, the Invest tab which is archived.

Could you rework all that, and go back a bit on the previous interface which was a little better thought anyway .... evidenced by the last comments of these 24 hours ...

EDIT: oh yes, I use the Invest tab a lot and I reiterate my point by saying that it's too messy. It should also be understood that the star at the top right is a button, in which we find his watch list for actions !!!

First, I couldn't login to the website because I didn't have the HSBC app on my phone to generate a Security Code (2). Tried to reset my security details (3), even though I remembered my Digital Secure Key password (4) through the automated phone call. No dice, because I didn't have my Telephone Banking Security Number (5). I was put through to an agent, who asked me more security questions, but I failed the last one -- I couldn't remember if I had an overdraft set up. I looked up some old bank statements and found the answer. So I called them again! Nope! If you failed on the first call, that's it, they won't help you reset your security details anymore!

"I joined Atom because of the decent interest rates on their fixed savings accounts and because the concept of app-based banking seemed promising.

Having experienced a year (and a bit) of using their app, I'm sad to report that the whole concept really doesn't work. As others have reported, Atom make a big thing about their app's animated graphical interface and unconventional technology (like user verification via face and voice recognition). Unfortunately, almost every element of this design makes the experience slower and more frustrating compared to equivalent apps from the established high street banks. 

Getting into the app is slow - for example it only takes around 14 seconds to access to the Lloyds banking app with fingerprint ID on iPhone vs more than double that time to access the Atom app on the same device. Once you're in, I find the user interface to be confusing and slow (animated floaty bubbles rather than simple clear lists.. why?). Almost everything about the experience feels frustrating compared to a normal bank - for example, when your savings account matures, you have a window of just a few days to nominate an account using the app (I tried, but it crashed and I gave up!), after which you have to call Atom and wait in a queue, before painstakingly going through the details on the phone. 

On the plus side, when you do speak to the Atom call centre, they seem friendly, knowledgeable and genuinely keen to help. However, the fact that I've had to make multiple calls in one year to sort out problems on just a couple of savings accounts highlights the issues with the app.

Do the good savings rates justify the hassle of using the App? Yes probably, but it just seems such a shame that Atom have been unable to invest all that development effort on things that add to the customer experience, rather than getting in the way!",['824.account-management.account-access.0']
"Dear tsb I am experiencing issues with my online banking and I am unable to transfer money from my isa to my classic plus account this has now been a week that I have been having issues with your bank and I recently sent an email to your complaints department which I may add say it deals with complaint within 3 day totally disgusting I will attach my previous complaint at the bottom here 

(...Thank you for your complaint Darren .

We have received your complaint and will do our best to call you as soon as we can. We value your feedback and appreciate the time you've taken to send it.

Details of your complaint:  My complaint is with regards to the lack of accessibility to my online/Internet banking account I fully understand the reason and the need for maintenance of I.T. systems but when I tried logging into my account this morning I was confronted with details and balance amounts that where not my own. I am now left here with no access and a poor apology message. I am extremely furious and extremely concerned as if someone else's details where shown to me when I looked at my account how am I to know that my details where not shown to someone else and on that how am I to know that the person that potential has seen my details wouldn't miss use the access they had to my account. I am totally disgusted this is not the first time that I have been completely horrified by the service I have received with TSB and I am seriously looking at moving my money to a new provider with a far better track recored of not letting customers down. I would also like this to be sorted extremely fast as this is a pressing matter for me if I do not see that this has been sorted correctly or in a reasonable time I will take it upon my self to contact try financial conduct authority and consult them in whats best to do as there has been a breach in my account.

How you have asked us to resolve it:  First of all: I would be greatly happy if you could give me access to my online account and I mean with my details not some else.
 Secondly: Some kind of an apology for the hassle and the complete breach of security and data protection.
 Thirdly: Compensation for the hassle.
 Fourthly I would also like to begin a reason behind why this has happened and I expect an investigation to be done.
 
 I would also like this to be done reasonably fast as if not done in a time I am happy with the I will be taking matter further and into the hands of the FCA...)",['824.account-management.account-access.0']

"Applied for a payment holiday on my credit card and a loan, received a text message saying they were being processed ok and sorry for delay . That was in early April and still haven't heard a word , now 25th June. Can't get through on the phone, letters are ignored and still no communication from Barclays and now I receive a letter saying that I am the hands of a debt collection agency! Went to my branch and no personal adviser there. The counter staff said ""they all want to leave anyway and that Barclays are utterly useless"". What a rubbish company they have become!!
My experience of Barclays is that immediately you tell them you have any financial problems, whatever the circumstances,you are regarded as their enemy to be ruthlessly and mercilessly persecuted into submission. You will be offered no help or support and will very rapidly find yourself harassed, threatened and bullied on a daily basis from 8am -10pm by Wescot who do their campaign of intimidation for them! Barclays are a very nasty bunch!
Five letters later and still no reply from Barclays. Have spent a total of 7 hours trying to call them and still been unable to speak to anyone! Impossible to email them. Live chat totally crashed after 4 minutes. Tried to make an appointment at my branch with a financial advisor and told they are all ill! 
It seems to me that all of the banks and esp Barclays are using Coronavirus as an excuse to make as many cuts to customer services as possible!
Now another 5 days and still no reply from Barclays. Had an answerphone message from them asking me to call them, but no number left and number withheld so impossible to call them back. The message said we will confirm this call by email. Guess what - no email! I think that Barclays are avoiding putting anything in writing so that the customer has no record of anything said - but they do of course!

"¬£600 was paid from our business account to pay invoices from another business. It turns out the invoices had been tampered with and the money was paid out twice, one of which was to an incorrect recipient. Despite our insistence and provision of evidence of suspicious activities Santander covered it up and would not help us get our money back. They know what bank it went to and that bank has asked for the funds to be returned but the person that received it, fraudulently, won‚Äôt give it back funnily enough. 

Of gravest concern is that Santander ruthlessly declined to class this as fraud, despite the clear legal definitions. They are determined to claim that we wilfully paid the money in error when we were defrauded into paying it twice.

You only know the character of an organisation when things go wrong. Santander is a Teflon shouldered head in sand bank that hirers the cleverest people it can in this department to try to talk their way out of supporting you.

"Do not use this app! I created an account on their website and downloaded  their app. Once logging into the app, the first letter of my email was capitalized, thus creating a new account. Each account can only have one social security number attached to it however. I‚Äôve called MoneyLion for two weeks to resolve the issue- each time you are guaranteed to be on hold for Atleast 25 minutes. 

The first time I was informed their site is case sensitive and that the issue was to be escalated to technical support to solve, I would get a response within 48 hours. The representative informed me that tons of other users were having issues with the app and logging in. The new account I created through the app I was informed to be deactivated. I attempted to log in with my current info and reset my password through the site numerous times, but constantly received an error stating it failed. I had still not heard from technical support so I created a new ticket and took a screenshot of the error.

I called again today to try and resolve the issue. I explained my situation to a different representative who informed myself that they could not fix the error that occurred on their site- I would have to use a new email address since that one was already used. I do not have another email, and should not have to create another email just for this app. I asked why they couldn‚Äôt just delete my account so I could start over and was informed that they cannot delete accounts- they can only deactivate them. 

In conclusion guys there are plenty of better apps out there- there‚Äôs Albert, Earnin and Dave that are all extremely helpful and user friendly without any issues such as the ones you will find on this app. Other users have written reviews with issues they have had as well on this app. Do not waste your time just to fall into the same circumstances.",['824.account-management.account-access.0']

I don't use my Trustcard very much because there are no perks that I can use. 
Also recently TSB changed my account type & I had no say in this. However the change is supposed to cause no difference. 
One thing that is a real nuisance is that I have no local bank. The nearest being in the city (a few miles away) which means either catching a bus OR taking the car & paying for parking. This is very annoying if I need to deposit cash or pay in a cheque.

"I have been an ING DIBA app user for 10 years and have now switched to N26: With the ING DIBA app, I was able to simply photograph invoices with my mobile phone and was done. Here I first have to create a contact, type the IBAN manually for the new contact and only then can I make a transfer to the contact. Very elaborate compared to before. I mean, if you want to have a contact, you can create one, but having to make a contact just to make a referral to a doctor or service provider does not help me. The fact that I have to type IBANs and cannot be read out of PDFs surprised me for a digital bank. Also the transfer with step 1, step 2 etc. may please some, but I prefer as before a page with all transfer details and say transfer below. Funny and one more step is that I can log in to the app with my fingerprint, but I can't use my fingerprint to authorise transfers, as with the ING DIBA app, but need an extra pin to do so. All in all, I find the app clear, but the core function of paying bills is considerably slower and more time consuming for me compared to the ING DIBA app. In November 2020, contact with N26 on a simple question was difficult. Chat bots reply first, but with unhelpful meaningless replies. After a few clicks you can chat with a member of staff of N26 and it seems friendly and you will be dumbfounded, but you also get almost exclusively text modules from the N26 and the many legal texts are so factual to unfriendly that you should rather stick with you if you text like that.

"I am only rating them 1 star as there is no zero star option. 
I took over the treasury role for a small local organisation in January this year. This involved creating a revised mandate for the 2 accounts we have. We were to have 2 new signatories on the accounts, remove 2 and keep 2 others on there. 4 signatories in total of which any 2 would be able to sign cheques. Problems were encountered right from the start, first it was that they would not accept any instruction from me, as I was not yet a signatory. Secondly they would not accept any instruction form the previous Treasurer as he was no longer a signatory. They were however still sending all correspondence to his address. Next, they couldn't get our name right, they weren't prepared to accept minutes of our AGM as proof that we were who we said we were, as the name was different to what they thought it was, despite us providing proof that there was no such entity as they thought we were.
Then after this was eventually sorted, they decided they needed new proofs of address and ID for all signatories on the account. Including the 2 who were already signatories. They refused the ID provided by one of the signatories, for no apparent reason, but anyway he eventually  went into the local branch (Ipswich) with documentation he was assured was sufficient. Hooray!, we assumed, this is it finally (now mid-October after initialising this in January), the mandate will now be agreed and we can carry on as before. Except no, on Saturday I got a letter saying they had been instructed to close the accounts, with no further explanation, plus a cheque attached for the closing balance, made out in the wrong name.

"For a few weeks whenever I logged into the Barclays Mobile Banking App it asked me to upgrade to the latest version. However, this was not possible as a message on the app stated:
'! Your device isn't compatible with this version'. I thought this strange as I have a Galaxy 7 Edge and Andriod 7.00, which certainly should not be a problem.

I ignored the message and carried on using the mobile banking app, thinking that whatever the problem was, it would get sorted before too long and in the meantime I'd continue to use the app.

But, then the last time I tried to log in, it would not let me and insisted I had to upgrade to the latest version before it would allow me back in.

I thought this meant they'd now fixed the app, but alas, no.

Several communications later via Facebook and Twitter, the quality of which on some of the replies was abysmal, it is STILL not fixed. All Barclays will say is that they are aware of this 'technical' issue and rest assured they are working to fix it, but they can't give a date when this will be fixed.

Baloney, I believe they are hoping that this problem goes away when next Android updates its operating system, I don't believe they are working on a fix at all and that is why they will not commit to say when the problem will be fixed.

I've decided to open a Monzo account and gradually move all of my business over to it. My son uses Monzo and says it is absolutely fantastic, with real-time updates, etc. They do not and will not have branches, but hey, many of us don't need the bricks and mortar banks any longer anyway.","['824.account-management.account-access.0', '824.online-experience.updates-versions.0']"

"Ok so I see a lot of people with bad experiences this is my experience with HSBC and I am a premier customer, so can‚Äôt say for any other account type

The staff I speak too on the phone always have an answer for me and I generally only have to wait 1-2 mins until I can speak to a person.

The phone app is easy to use, I just wish it had the function to be able to set up standing orders then I don‚Äôt need to use the online portal.

I recently secured a new interest rate for my mortgage. It was as simple as logging in, finding the rate I was happy with, and clicking apply. It took all of 5 minutes to sort out, and I‚Äôm now locked in at a very good rate.

I am self employed so the mortgage requirements are quite bulky to prove your earnings. I had a 90 minute meeting and it took 4 days to approve my mortgage! I was told by an Ifa it would take over 48 days with them and that just wasn‚Äôt true!!!

The interest rates on the ISA and savings accounts are not the worst but are no way near the best. I found the regular saver at 5% very good though and make full use of that (from what I can see this is the best rate you can get, some banks also offer 5% but none offer higher)

I‚Äôve always found the staff friendly, and they go out of their way to help you! I always get a coffee and a biscuit when I go in branch, and they also helped me with questions about online functionality.

They resolve complaints that I have had quickly, and generally err on my side which is good.

Their connected app which lets you log in all of your bank accounts from different banks so you can see all your money in one place is awful. It‚Äôs obviously been rushed and I‚Äôve had nothing but issues with it, so much so I‚Äôve given up with it (this is where they lose a star for me)

I find the travel insurance that comes with the premier account for free very good. I have had to claim on it and it was as simple as calling up, they sent a claim form, I sent all the documents needed and 5 days later I had a payment in my account. Really easy to use!

Overall I find them a good bank, I have multiple accounts with different banks and I have always found Hsbc the best overall bank. For everyday banking they are great, but think about putting your savings in another bank to get the best rate, unless your using the regular saver. That way you get the best of everything.

I think in this day and age it is not unreasonable to have 2-3 accounts with different banks going to make use of what every bank does best.

"Account was opened just a few months and during that time they blocked the account twice for suspicious activity (i.e. me putting some funds into my SIPP and paying a couple of guys for some building work) and then subsequently closed the account the day before Christmas, leaving me with no bank account during the festive period.  Even now (10/1/2018) the funds that were in that account have not been transferred to my new account (held elsewhere) despite being told that would take 5 days to receive the funds.  So these funds have been locked up over the whole of the festive period, thanks for that NatWest!

This bank historically hava a reputation for poor customer service. To be fair, the staff I've spoken to have been quite helpful, it's the processes and systems in place that are complete cr@p.  The bank is rotten to the core and will never be back despite being a former customer of their private banking arm Coutts. 

Getting through to their customer service teams is a task in itself, be prepared to wait on hold for 30 mins at a time.  Not sure if the problem is lack of staff or just too many customers calling with issues, either way it's unacceptable, bad management and a shocking company to deal with.

"I like this app for my everyday banking. I won't repeat what others have said, but there's always room for improvement. There still is. Eg. why do all the secure messages still have the default date of 20th May? The last two updates haven't resolved this completely. The list of messages still shows them all as 20th May, however the correct date is showing on opening each message now.  I still think swiping back to the previous page rather than clicking on the back arrow top left would be more helpful and intuitive. You can swipe back in other instances after all. The larger phone screens get the more awkward it is to stretch one's thumbs.  The other things that still bug me are to do with banking processes eg. real-time pending debit payments are missing and not to do with the app necessarily. But I miss them all the same. I like to see my cleared and available balances detailed properly.

"Um es vorweg zu sagen:
N26 hat den langsamsten und schlechtesten Kundenservice aller mir bekannten Banken!

Leider gilt auch trotz der nun gegr√ºndeten N26 Bank, dass der Support viel zu langsam, oft unwissend und nicht immer freundlich (Telefon) und auch zu ungenau (ich h√§tte wesentlich mehr Transparenz erwartet) ist. 
Man muss bei seiner Bank einen Ansprechpartner haben, dem man direkt am Telefon etwas erkl√§ren kann. Nicht alles geht per Mail. Und dann eine Stunde (oder l√§nger, wenn mehrfach angerufen werden muss) zu warten um jemanden zu sprechen, dass ist absolut nicht ok. N26 ist eine Bank, da geht es um das Geld der Kunden (mit dem die Bank Geld verdient). Da ist so etwas unabdingbar!

Auch ist es durch die oft schnell angezeigten aber noch gar nicht wirklich gebuchten Betr√§ge sehr schwer, den Kontostand nachzuvollziehen oder zu bemerken (wenn der Dispo aktiviert ist), dass man jetzt eigentlich ins Minus geht, obwohl der angezeigte Kontostand eigentlich reichen m√ºsste. Mann muss sehr aufpassen und nachrechnen. Das macht den Umgang mit dem Konto sehr schwer. 
Nachtr√§glich ver√§nderte Wechselkurse werden nirgends angezeigt, es wird darauf hingewiesen, jedoch muss man sich dann einige Tage sp√§ter, wenn die eigentliche Buchung erfolgt, erst durchklicken um den aktuellen Kurs zu sehen. 
Das bearbeiten von unberechtigten Abbuchungen dauert bis zu zwei Wochen...das ist absolut nicht in Ordnung. 
Auch funktioniert das Kennzeichensymbol bei Push Benachrichtigungen nicht und man kann die App nicht gleichzeitig auf dem iPad nutzen (auch ist die App nicht f√ºr das iPad angepasst).

"We moved to Starling 4 months ago, the onboarding was simple and well thought through and whilst they are pretty good (and have great ethical credentials which is V important), there are a few things which I feel let them down. My boyfriend and I went to Starling from Chatterbank so that we could get a proper joint account, instead of having a travel card we could both access, meaning we had to open separate individual accounts first. The bank cards for the sole and joint accounts look exactly the same..same colour, don‚Äôt even say joint on them, both cards only have our individual name so when you look in your wallet you have no idea which is which (meaning we have had to take a sharpie to it which sorta ruins the aesthetic they were going for), the app is also treads a fine line of being chic and minimalist and just quite confusing at times, with it not being particularly easy to find where your transactions are etc at first.

"Where do I start. I joined first direct due to its good reputation. My mum Banks with them. At first everything was OK. I then ran into issues going paper free. Despite asking numerous times, to this day, they still send me stuff. The online banking has always been an issue. To many codes and a badly designed site. The app has given me so much greef. Just trying to transfer money can make me want to throw my phone across the room in frustration. Then they just don't keep up with the times. Is first direct the only bank you can't scan cheques to? It must be. An absolute disaster for disabled people. Then the online complaints page won't take my complaint and aparently there is no other way to send it. Apparently first direct have never heard of emails. You also used to be able to get through over the phone very quickly. This has changed recently. There is an awful noise, sounds like birds and wind and you often can't get through. Things are changing and not for the better.

UPDATE From 2 to 1 star 
I received an email from the digital team saying I had sent them an email and they can't verify me via an email and I should contact them. At no time did I email them. So I tried to find out by calling and was told that they have no record of this email. That is worrying in itself. It turns out the email probably referred to a message I sent on Facebook in which I was asked for my name, address etc. She also read out this review from trust pilot, which they had attached to my account. I'd quite like to know, how they verified that. If you can't verify someones email?
I just got a call from someone who was too busy talking over me than helping me. I am now moving to another bank. She wasn't able to offer any solutions. IF YOU ARE DISABLED, AVOID THIS BANK. THEY DO NOT SUPPORT DISABLED People. I'm in the process of taking this bank to the ombudsman and I'm also being supported by the equities and human rights commission. First direct don't grasp that some people can't get out to banks and also they can't suggest you get someone else to do it for you.
